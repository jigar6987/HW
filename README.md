# Personal-Projects
Purpose of this project is to demonstrate some Derivative Pricing Models and Value at Risk Models implemented on Python notebook along with code comments and background.

These are:
- Binomial Trees Model for American/European Option Valuations with unlimited tree steps.
- Random Forest & Support Vector Machine based Model for prediction of Long/Short trades on Nifty along with becktesting results.
- Black-Scholes Option pricing Model with greeks
- Option Pricing using Monte-Carlo Simulation
- Market Risk(VaR) using Monte-Carlo Simulations
- Market Risk(VaR) using Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
- Vasicek & CIR short rate models with calibration
- Stochastic alpha beta rho (SABR) Model with calibration
- Portfolio Optimization using MPT
- Simple Single Factor Libor Market Model
