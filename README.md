# Personal-Projects
Purpose of this project is to demonstrate some Derivative Pricing Models and Value at Risk Models implemented on Python notebook.

These are:
1) Random Forest & Support Vector Machine based Model for prediction of Long/Short trades on Nifty along with becktesting results.
2) Black-Scholes Option pricing Model with greeks
3) Option Pricing using Monte-Carlo Simulation
4) Market Risk(VaR) using Monte-Carlo Simulations
5) Market Risk(VaR) using Principal Component Analysis(PCA)
6) Vasicek & CIR short rate models with calibration
7) Stochastic alpha beta rho (SABR) Model with calibration
8) Portfolio Optimization using MPT
9) Simple Single Factor Libor Market Model
